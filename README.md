Treehouse Project 3: Interactive Form

    This code has been written to add interactivity to a form. 
    The example is a pretend JS conference. The name input is auto-focused for accessibilty 
    and showing where the information needs to be input first. The tshirt option is such that one cannot select a 
    T-shirt if the color doesn't come in the color and design.
    
    You can also add your information needed to register, 
    and choose a list of talks that if one interfers with another, 
    they are greyed out and you cannot select them. It adds up the total cost.
    
    Payment information is validated and cannot be incorrect, otherwise an error message appears.
    Finally depending on what payment method is selected, a message will appear telling you further instructons.

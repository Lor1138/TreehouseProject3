  Treehouse_Project3: Interactive Form
  
  This code has been written to add iteractivity to a form. 
    The example is a pretend JS conference, where you can add your information needed to register, and choose a list of talks that if one interfers with another, they are greyed out and you cannot select them. 

    The payment option is such that if you choose another payment method you are given a message relevant to your choice.

    If the credit card information isn't correct, the input is colored red, if correct, green.
